This is documentation of the components that are a part of this site. These docs are mainly generated by using [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen) with [gatsby-transformer-react-docgen](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-transformer-react-docgen), some GraphQL functionality with MDX from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and some components from [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) to create a sandbox so the components can be played with and show the results in a preview. This is loosely based off of [React Styleguideist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/); however, this is more integrated in Gatsby with a customized layout.

Not all components will have a sandbox. Only those that have an mdx file associated with them. The way it works is when Gatsby builds, it runs a GraphQL query using the Gatsby qraphql library searching for any .mdx files in the /src/docs directory for documentation not associated with components and builds pages from the results of that query as well as adding them to the [@reach/router library](https://reach.tech/router). Another Gatsby graphql query is run for any components that have props in the same way as the docs and also creates pages in the same way. When a component page loads, it additionally looks for a .mdx file with the same name as the component. If one exists, the mdx from that file is also added to that components page. Inside the component's mdx file, there may be code within there that uses \```js live ... \``` to indicate there needs to be a sandbox for that component. A good example of this would be the [Button.mdx](https://github.com/bruqui/my-portfolio/blob/master/src/components/core/Button.mdx) file. If you click on the link, be sure to view the raw content to see how it's set up.
