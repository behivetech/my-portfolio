All Gatsby page specific components are placed in the `src/pages` directory. Any other components are placed in the `src/components` directory by this logic. Anything core such as buttons, input fields, icons, etc. are placed inside of the `core` directory. Anything specific to global site layout are placed in the `layouts` directory. All others are placed in the `app` directory. If there's multiple components related to the same area such as a page, then a sub directory is created within the `app` directory labeled to which page it is related to. All other `app` global type components are directly under `app`.

Import order is important for styling purposes. Be sure to always import core components before any other site components. Always keep core components imported in alpha numeric order. Site components should always be ordered by component parent before the component child. By doing so, it insures that the styling of the last component overrides the component imported before it. To summarize, components should be imported by core first (alpha order), layout next (parent/child order) and lastly app (parent/child order).

To keep a naming convention for the styling, always use the getClassName function from `tools/getClassName.js`
